Compendium of Principal Investigators and Research Groups for Funded Master's Studies in Aerospace Control Systems: A Strategic Analysis for Prospective Graduate Students

Section 1: Introduction and Strategic Overview
1.1. Purpose and Scope of this Report
This report presents a meticulously researched and verified compendium of university professors and their associated research laboratories who are highly likely to offer funded Master's-level positions in the field of aerospace control systems. The technical focus is specifically aligned with the areas of thrust vector control (TVC) and the application of core control methodologies, including Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR), and Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controllers.
The primary audience for this document is a prospective graduate student from Bangladesh possessing a strong undergraduate foundation in engineering and seeking to pursue a funded Master of Science degree, which is typically research-based and thesis-driven. The objective is to provide a strategic dossier that transcends a simple list of names, offering instead a nuanced analysis of each potential supervisor's research alignment, funding prospects, and institutional standing. This enables the prospective student to craft highly targeted, compelling, and effective applications.
The structure of this report is hierarchical. It begins with a strategic overview of the academic landscape and funding mechanisms. It then categorizes potential faculty into three tiers:
•	Primary Candidates: Researchers with a direct and explicit focus on propulsion, rocketry, and thrust vector control.
•	Secondary Candidates: A broader and more opportunity-rich category of leading experts in the application of advanced control methodologies to analogous aerospace problems, such as Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) of satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and planetary landers.
•	Tertiary Candidates: Foundational theorists in optimal and robust control whose fundamental work underpins the applications in the previous sections.
Finally, the report concludes with actionable recommendations for prioritizing contacts and structuring a successful application strategy.
1.2. The Modern Research Landscape in Aerospace Control
A critical understanding for any prospective student is that modern control systems research is profoundly interdisciplinary. While a search may begin in a Department of Aerospace Engineering, leading-edge work relevant to TVC is frequently conducted within Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and specialized Robotics Institutes. For instance, a university like the University of Michigan has a dedicated Controls Group that draws faculty and resources from multiple engineering departments, creating a rich, collaborative environment. Similarly, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) notes that faculty active in systems and control research are found across Aerospace, Mechanical, Industrial, and Chemical Engineering departments. This report reflects this reality by profiling faculty from a range of departmental affiliations.   
Furthermore, a crucial distinction must be made between research focused on a specific application (e.g., thrust vector control) and research focused on a control methodology (e.g., LQR/LQG). A search limited to faculty who explicitly list "thrust vector control" as a primary research interest will yield a very small and potentially misleading list of opportunities. The foundational principles of LQR and LQG control—which involve state-space modeling, optimization of a quadratic cost function, and state estimation via a Kalman filter—are universal. A professor who develops and applies LQG controllers for the attitude control of a satellite is working with a system dynamically analogous to a launch vehicle controlled via TVC. Both are rigid bodies whose orientation is controlled by managing forces and torques. The underlying mathematical framework, simulation tools, and theoretical challenges are nearly identical. Therefore, the largest and most promising pool of potential supervisors consists of experts in the   
methodology who apply their work to any relevant aerospace system. This report is structured to guide the applicant toward this larger pool of opportunity, where a thesis on TVC would be a novel and welcome application of the professor's core expertise.
1.3. Identifying Funding Opportunities: A Strategic Framework
For international students seeking a Master's degree in the United States and other top-tier research nations, funding is almost exclusively provided through Graduate Research Assistantships (GRAs). A GRA is not a scholarship in the traditional sense; it is an employment contract. The student is paid a stipend and receives a tuition waiver in exchange for performing research that contributes to a professor's funded grant. Consequently, the availability of a funded Master's position is directly tied to a professor's ability to secure and maintain research funding. Identifying well-funded research groups is therefore a primary objective of the application process.
Several key indicators signal a well-funded and active research program:
•	Prestigious Early-Career Awards: Grants such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, the NASA Early Career Faculty Award, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program are highly competitive and provide significant, multi-year funding to promising junior faculty. Professors Dimitra Panagou at the University of Michigan and Ran Dai at Purdue University are recipients of such awards, marking them as national leaders in their fields with active, funded research programs designed to support graduate students.   
•	Large and Active Research Laboratories: The size and composition of a professor's lab are strong indicators of their funding level. A lab with a significant number of Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers, such as Professor Marco Pavone's Autonomous Systems Laboratory at Stanford, which lists dozens of current members and alumni, is indicative of a large and diverse portfolio of research grants capable of supporting multiple students.   
•	Established Government and Industry Collaborations: Long-term partnerships with government agencies like NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD), or with major aerospace corporations such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, provide a stable stream of research funding. Professor Jonathan How's work at MIT, for example, involves close collaboration with such entities, ensuring that his research is both well-resourced and directed at solving real-world problems.   
By analyzing these indicators, a prospective student can move beyond simply assessing academic fit and begin to strategically target professors who are most likely to have the financial resources to support a new Master's student. Each profile in this report will include a "Funding Outlook" analysis based on these criteria.
Section 2: Primary Candidates: Direct Specialization in Propulsion and Thrust Vector Control
This section identifies principal investigators whose research portfolios explicitly include propulsion systems, rocket engine design, and thrust vector control. While this represents the most direct alignment with the stated research interest, this field is highly specialized. The number of academics for whom TVC is a primary research focus is limited, as the topic is often subsumed within broader GNC or aerodynamics research. The individuals and groups listed here represent the core of this specialized community.
Professor Name	Institution	Department(s)	Primary Research Area	Specific Relevance to TVC/LQR/LQG	Lab/Research Group
Paulo Lozano	Massachusetts Institute of Technology	Aeronautics and Astronautics	Electric Propulsion, Space Systems	Fundamental expertise in rocket engine design and plume dynamics; advises on advanced TVC concepts.	Space Propulsion Laboratory (SPL)

2.1. Professor Paulo Lozano, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Professor Lozano is a leading figure in advanced space propulsion at one of the world's premier aerospace engineering departments. While his primary research focus is on electrospray propulsion and micro-thruster technology, his foundational expertise in rocket propulsion principles makes him a highly relevant candidate. His direct involvement in supervising and guiding student projects on advanced TVC concepts is a matter of public record. A 2023 MIT thesis on "Magnetic Plume Steerage," a novel form of non-mechanical TVC, explicitly credits Professor Lozano for providing the analytical basis for the rocket design and for guidance on the complex chemical calculations involved. The same thesis discusses existing TVC technologies, including gimbaled engines, vanes, and fluidic injection, demonstrating that these topics are well within the academic scope of his research group. An approach to Professor Lozano should emphasize a strong interest in the fundamental physics of rocket plumes and a desire to explore novel actuation methods for vehicle control.

The limited number of academics whose work is defined explicitly by "thrust vector control" underscores its status as a specialized application area. This finding reinforces the central strategy of this report: the most effective path to securing a funded Master's position is to engage with the much larger community of researchers who are experts in the underlying control methodologies and apply them to a wide range of aerospace systems. The following sections are therefore dedicated to this broader, more opportunity-rich landscape.
Section 3: Secondary Candidates: Advanced Applications in Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)
This section constitutes the core of the report, profiling principal investigators in Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) whose research provides an ideal foundation for a Master's thesis on thrust vector control. These faculty are leaders in applying optimal, robust, and adaptive control techniques—including LQR and LQG—to complex aerospace vehicles such as satellites, autonomous aircraft, and planetary landers. The mathematical and engineering principles they employ are directly transferable to the TVC problem. These professors typically lead large, well-funded laboratories with a consistent need for talented graduate students.

3.1. Professor Jonathan P. How, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Professor Jonathan How is a world-renowned authority in the field of aerospace controls and autonomous systems. As the Director of the MIT Aerospace Controls Laboratory (ACL), he leads a large and dynamic research group focused on robust planning, decision-making, and control for single and multi-vehicle systems. His research, while often focused on UAVs and spacecraft formations, is deeply rooted in the principles of optimal and robust control theory, making him an exceptional candidate to supervise a thesis on advanced TVC applications.   
Professor How's work on "adaptive flight control to enable autonomous agile flight and aerobatics" has a direct conceptual linkage to the primary purpose of thrust vectoring, which is to achieve high maneuverability and attitude control in regimes where aerodynamic surfaces are ineffective. The algorithms developed in his lab for real-time trajectory planning, collision avoidance, and decision-making under uncertainty often rely on techniques like mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and model predictive control (MPC), which are closely related to the LQR framework. A Master's thesis proposing the use of these advanced planning and control architectures for a launch vehicle, using TVC as the primary actuation mechanism, would align well with the ACL's research thrust.   
•	Name: Jonathan P. How
•	Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
•	Lab: Aerospace Controls Laboratory (ACL)   
•	Email: jhow@mit.edu   
•	Recent Publications: Professor How's publication record is extensive. Recent work focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning, certifiable robustness for neural networks, and safe motion planning in uncertain environments. Representative titles include "Motion planning among dynamic, decision-making agents with deep reinforcement learning" and "Aircraft trajectory planning with collision avoidance using mixed integer linear programming".

3.2. Professor Dimitra Panagou, University of Michigan
Professor Dimitra Panagou is a prominent researcher in nonlinear systems and control, with a specific focus on the safe and resilient operation of autonomous multi-vehicle systems. She is an Associate Professor in both the Department of Aerospace Engineering and the Robotics Institute at the University of Michigan, where she directs the Distributed Aerospace Systems and Control (DASC) Laboratory.   
Her research is highly relevant to the application of LQR/LQG to TVC, particularly her work on constrained control. One of her highly cited recent papers, "Robust control barrier functions under high relative degree and input constraints for satellite trajectories," deals directly with the challenges of controlling aerospace vehicles subject to physical limitations—a core problem in TVC design where actuator slew rates and maximum deflection angles are critical constraints. The use of control barrier functions (CBFs) combined with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in a quadratic programming framework is a modern evolution of the optimal control principles embodied by LQR. A thesis that applies these advanced, safety-critical control techniques to the TVC problem would be a logical and compelling extension of her group's work.   
•	Name: Dimitra Panagou
•	Institution: University of Michigan
•	Lab: Distributed Aerospace Systems and Control (DASC) Laboratory   
•	Email: dpanagou@umich.edu   
•	Recent Publications: Her recent work focuses on fixed-time stability, control barrier functions, resilient multi-agent consensus, and safe control synthesis. Key publications include "Fixed-time stable gradient flows: Applications to continuous-time optimization" and "Robust control barrier and control Lyapunov functions with fixed-time convergence guarantees".

These prestigious, multi-year awards are a definitive indicator of a robust, active, and well-funded research program with a clear mandate to train and support graduate students.   
3.3. Professor Ran Dai, Purdue University
Professor Ran Dai is an Associate Professor in the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University, an institution with a storied history in aerospace engineering. Her research is centered on the control of autonomous systems, numerical optimization, and networked dynamical systems, with a strong emphasis on space exploration missions.   
Her work is exceptionally well-aligned with the user's interests due to her focus on optimal guidance for planetary landing. She received a NASA Early Career Faculty Award for her project on "Optimized Entry and Powered Descent Guidance for Precision Planetary Landing". This problem is the inverse of the launch problem but involves the same core challenge: controlling engine thrust (magnitude and direction) to follow a fuel-optimal trajectory to a precise target in the presence of atmospheric disturbances and system constraints. Her research explicitly employs optimal control and machine learning-based methods to solve these problems in real-time. A Master's thesis applying her lab's techniques for fuel-optimal powered descent to the problem of fuel-optimal ascent and orbital insertion using TVC would be a perfect fit and a natural extension of her funded research.

•	Funding Outlook: Excellent. Professor Dai is a recipient of both an NSF CAREER Award and a NASA Early Faculty Career Award. These awards signify strong, stable funding from the primary agencies supporting advanced space GNC research, indicating a high likelihood of available positions for graduate research assistants.   
3.4. Professor Marco Pavone, Stanford University
Professor Marco Pavone is a leading figure in the field of autonomous systems, holding positions as an Associate Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University and as a Distinguished Research Scientist at NVIDIA. He is the director of the Stanford Autonomous Systems Laboratory (ASL), a large and highly influential research group dedicated to the analysis, design, and control of autonomous systems, including self-driving cars and autonomous aerospace vehicles.   
The core philosophy of the ASL is the development of "provably-correct algorithms" for systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments, combining expertise from control theory, robotics, optimization, and machine learning. This rigorous, theory-grounded approach to autonomy aligns perfectly with the mathematical formalism of LQR/LQG control. While much of the lab's recent high-profile work has been in autonomous driving, Professor Pavone's background is rooted in aerospace, with prior work at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and research on autonomous aerospace vehicles remaining a key part of the lab's portfolio. His work on optimal control, chance-constrained dynamic programming, and robust motion planning provides the ideal theoretical toolkit for tackling the TVC problem. Given the scale of his lab, a project on robust TVC for launch vehicles could easily be accommodated within a subgroup focused on aerospace autonomy.

•	Google Scholar Link:(https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RhOpyXcAAAAJ)   
•	Funding Outlook: Exceptional. Professor Pavone is a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), an ONR Young Investigator Award, an NSF CAREER Award, and a NASA Early Career Faculty Award. His lab is one of the largest and most well-funded in the field of autonomy, with extensive support from government and industry. Competition for positions is extremely high, but the resources are abundant.   
Section 4: Tertiary Candidates: Foundational Theorists in Optimal and Robust Control
This section profiles world-leading theorists in control engineering. While their research may be more abstract and not tied to a specific aerospace application, they are the architects of the mathematical tools—including and extending beyond LQR/LQG—that are used by the applied researchers in Section 3. A student with an exceptionally strong background in mathematics and a desire to work on the fundamental properties of control systems could find a home in these groups. An application to these professors should be framed differently: the student should propose using the thrust vector control problem as a challenging and practical test case to validate or extend the professor's theoretical work.

4.1. Professor Wassim M. Haddad, Georgia Institute of Technology
Professor Wassim Haddad is a towering figure in modern control theory. As the David S. Lewis Professor of Dynamical Systems and Control at Georgia Tech, his work has profoundly influenced the fields of nonlinear, robust, and adaptive control. He is the author of several seminal textbooks, including   
Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Control: A Lyapunov-based Approach, which is a standard graduate-level text. His research is highly mathematical, focusing on the fundamental principles of stability, dissipativity, and optimality for complex dynamical systems.   
While his publications do not typically focus on specific hardware applications, they provide the rigorous theoretical foundation upon which methods like LQR and LQG are built and extended. For example, his work on robust control with uncertainty is directly applicable to designing a TVC system that can perform reliably despite variations in atmospheric density, wind gusts, and changes in vehicle mass as propellant is consumed. Approaching Professor Haddad would require a student to demonstrate exceptional mathematical maturity. The most successful pitch would involve identifying a specific theoretical framework from his work—for instance, hierarchical nonlinear switching control or control for hybrid systems—and proposing to apply it to the TVC problem, which can be modeled as a system with switching dynamics (e.g., between stages of flight).

4.2. Professors at The University of Texas at Austin
The Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at The University of Texas at Austin hosts a formidable group of faculty specializing in systems and control theory. Their work bridges the gap between fundamental theory and high-impact applications in aerospace and robotics.   
4.2.1. Professor Efstathios Bakolas
Professor Bakolas is an Associate Professor whose research is centered on optimal and stochastic control theory. His work is directly relevant to a student interested in LQG. A significant portion of his research focuses on "optimal covariance control" for stochastic linear systems, which is a sophisticated generalization of the LQG problem. In LQG, the goal is to minimize the expected value of a quadratic cost, whereas in covariance control, the goal is to steer the state covariance matrix itself to a desired terminal value. This has powerful applications in problems where managing the uncertainty of the vehicle's state is paramount, such as in precision targeting or orbital insertion. A thesis exploring the application of covariance steering to the TVC problem for minimizing landing footprint uncertainty would be a strong fit for his research interests.

•	Funding Outlook: Strong. As a tenured faculty member in a top-ranked department with a focus on high-demand areas like optimal and stochastic control, his research is likely well-supported by federal grants.
4.2.2. Professor David Fridovich-Keil
Professor Fridovich-Keil is an Assistant Professor whose research lies at the intersection of optimal control, dynamic game theory, and machine learning for control. His work is notable for developing computationally efficient algorithms to solve complex, multi-agent motion planning problems. A core component of his methodology is the use of "iterative linear-quadratic approximations" to handle nonlinear dynamics and general-sum game-theoretic scenarios. This means his work repeatedly solves LQR-like problems as a fundamental step in a more complex algorithm. This expertise in the computational aspects of LQR and its application to real-time motion planning is directly applicable to generating optimal TVC-driven trajectories for launch vehicles or missiles, especially in scenarios requiring obstacle avoidance or maneuvering against an adversary.   
•	Name: David Fridovich-Keil
•	Institution: The University of Texas at Austin

Section 5: Strategic Recommendations for Contact and Application
Possessing a curated list of potential advisors is the first step. The second, more critical step is leveraging that information to execute a successful application campaign. This section provides a strategic framework for a prospective student from Bangladesh to maximize their chances of securing a funded Master's position.
5.1. Prioritizing the List
Not all candidates are of equal potential for every student. The list should be prioritized based on the student's specific academic background, technical skills, and research aspirations. A suggested prioritization scheme is as follows:
•	Tier 1 (Highest Priority): This tier includes professors from Section 3 (GNC Applications) whose work is highly analogous to the TVC problem. Professors Ran Dai (Purdue) and Dimitra Panagou (U. Michigan) are prime examples. Their research on planetary landing and constrained satellite control, respectively, combined with their prestigious early-career funding, makes them the ideal targets. Their work requires a strong foundation in control theory and aerospace dynamics, but is less abstract than that of the foundational theorists.
•	Tier 2 (High Priority): This tier includes the world-leading GNC and autonomy experts with larger, more diverse labs, such as Professor Jonathan P. How (MIT) and Professor Marco Pavone (Stanford). While the competition for positions in these labs is immense, their significant resources mean they may have more openings. This tier also includes the direct TVC specialists from Section 2, like Professor Paulo Lozano (MIT), if the student has a particularly strong interest in propulsion hardware and physics.
•	Tier 3 (Specialized Priority): This tier consists of the foundational theorists from Section 4, such as Professor Wassim M. Haddad (Georgia Tech) and the control theory faculty at UT Austin. These professors should be prioritized only by students who possess an exceptionally strong background in advanced mathematics (e.g., real analysis, functional analysis, advanced linear algebra) and who are comfortable with highly theoretical research.
5.2. Crafting the Initial Contact Email
The initial email to a professor is the single most important part of the pre-application process. It must be professional, concise, and demonstrate genuine intellectual curiosity. A generic, mass-produced email will be ignored.
Subject: Prospective MS Student Inquiry: - Research in
Body:
•	Salutation: "Dear Professor [Last Name],"
•	Introduction (1-2 sentences): State your name, your current institution (e.g., Bangladesh University of Dhaka), your major, and that you are a prospective Master's student for the Fall term.
•	Demonstrate Specific Interest (2-3 sentences): This is the most critical part. Mention by name one or two of their recent publications that you have read and understood. For example: "I have been following your group's research with great interest, particularly your 2023 paper in Automatica on robust control barrier functions for satellite trajectories. The approach of using quadratic programming to enforce input constraints is highly relevant to my interests." Then, connect their work to your specific interest.
